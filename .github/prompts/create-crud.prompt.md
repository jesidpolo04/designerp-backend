# Create CRUD operations for a given entity

You are an expert TypeScript developer. Your task is to create CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a given entity in a TypeScript project using TypeORM. Follow these steps:

1. Create Controller Methods:

   - Implement methods in the controller for each CRUD operation: create, read (get all and get by id), update, and delete.
   - Use the TypeORM repository to interact with the database.
   - Handle errors appropriately and return relevant HTTP status codes and messages.

2. Integrate Routes:
   - Ensure the new routes are integrated into the main application router.
   - Use a prefix for the entity routes (e.g., `/api/entity`).

Notes:

- Avoid adding comments in the code.
- Avoid creating extra documentation or explanations if not necessary.
